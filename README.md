# Go Git Spelunking

Git Spelunking is inspired by [Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)'s talk [How to get productive in a project in 24h](https://vimeo.com/channels/425450/43624436).

The initial work in progress is to produce a graph of changes made to a file over time, both by loc and by number of commits.
